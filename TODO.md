1. Get resnet model trained for all geology, geochemical, and geophysical data (Angel) (done)
3. Try to get variable importannce for layers / prediction but based on CNN (Vasily - done)
    * output would be something like a raster of the same dimensionlaity as the input raster
    but each element contains some normalized importance of that input value (similar to information value
    but for every pixel)
    * if above is not possible, then normalized average importance over the layers as output (more similar to infromation value)
4. Produce all deliverables for first hackathon (Angel & Vasily - done)
    * Slide deck to walk through demos (done)
        * Highlight our moat(s) / strengths (done)
        * Outline connections to other TAs (done)
    * Demo(s) (done)
    * Ablation(s) (done)
    * Tentative agenda / "read ahead" (done)
    * APIs / Docs (done)
5. Produce North America only corresponding table of results (Vasily - mostly done)
7. Need to address the issues with spatial cross validation (done)
--------
6. Remove s2 grid eventually
