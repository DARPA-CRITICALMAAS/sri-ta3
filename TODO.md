1. Get resnet model trained for all geology, geochemical, and geophysical data (Angel)
2. Produce output maps for results to get feedback from Gina (Angel)
3. Try to get variable importannce for layers / prediction but based on CNN (Vasily)
    * output would be something like a raster of the same dimensionlaity as the input raster
    but each element contains some normalized importance of that input value (similar to information value
    but for every pixel)
    * if above is not possible, then normalized average importance over the layers as output (more similar to infromation value)
4. Produce all deliverables for first hackathon (Angel)
    * ...
5. Produce North America only corresponding table of results (Vasily)
6. Remove s2 grid eventually
7. Need to address the issues with spatial cross validation
